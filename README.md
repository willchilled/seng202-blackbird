1 INTRODUCTION

BlackBird is a desktop application for organising, editing, viewing and
creation  of large data-sets concerning airports, airlines, routes and flights,
as well as providing various forms of analyses to the user on this data. It
is designed primarily for startup airlines to provide the end goal of
answering two key questions: Where should planes fly? and how should they get
there? BlackBird is an open source product and all the code is available from
https://github.com/Marethyu1/BlackBird

It imports standard CSV files of each data type and displays them in a user
friendly GUI whilst also sorting this data persistently in a databse. The
standard CSV file formats can be found at the following sites:

  Airports:  http://openflights.org/data.html#airport
  Airlines:  http://openflights.org/data.html#airline
  Routes:    http://openflights.org/data.html#route
  Flights:   https://flightplandatabase.com/planner
